The script makexhip.sh download the required files, compile and launch the program 
cdc_xhip.pp that merge and extract the data to the file cdc_xhip.dat

The file cdc_xhip.dat is used to merge with Gaia data in ../gaia-dr3/

The resulting file catgen_gaiahip.dat is used with Catgen and the project 
file gaiahip.prj to build the binary catalog.

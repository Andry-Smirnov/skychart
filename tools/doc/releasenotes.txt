Version 4.1.1 beta, release Notes

New functions:

- It is now possible to use a telescope connected to a remote ASCOM Windows computer from Skychart running on Linux or macOS. See: https://github.com/ASCOMInitiative/ASCOMRemote/blob/master/Documentation/ASCOM%20Remote%20Concept.pdf
- The resolution of the background image can now be limited to improve the performance if the screen is too big or if there is not enough cpu core.
- Client/server communication can now use J2000 coordinates instead of the current chart setting. You can change this option in Setup/General/Server.
- Remove obsolete/unmaintainable lx200 and encoder drivers. Please use the corresponding ASCOM or INDI drivers.
  - for generic lx200: https://pixelstelescopes.wordpress.com/advanced-lx200/
  - for digital circle: http://eksfiles.net/digital-setting-circles/ascom-driver-for-digital-setting-circles/
- Depreciate the use of Mysql database and suggest to move to Sqlite if currently in use.
- Allow to lock at the position set from the menu View/Position.
- Support for the new GAIA DR2 star catalog.
- Allow to use HNSKY star catalog using the "290" format.
- Improve double star display.
- Improve magnitude filter for small FOV.
- Show the object rise and set time relative to the local horizon if a horizon file is loaded. This can be disabled in Setup/Observatory. Calendar rise/set are always given to the astronomical horizon.
- New icon for the buttons better suited for night vision filters, use larger image for big buttons.
- Set observatory coordinates from telescope GPS, use "Telescope" observatory name.
- Improve download progress display.
- Many bug fix.

Change the version number to 4.1.1 because of the way git count the number of revision.
Last revision in subversion was 3731, this is equivalent to git commit b414c933 revision 3667.
This revision number is now only used to make a sequential version number, use the commit hash show in the About box to get the corresponding source code version.

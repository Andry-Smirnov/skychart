Version 4.3 beta, release Notes

New calculation of the planetary satellites with CALCEPH library:
To have the best possible precision of the position it is now possible to calculate it using a SPICE kernel.
To do this, you have to install the corresponding data files from:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/skychart/files/2-catalogs/SpiceKernel/
The skychart-spice-base file is required and you can add skychart-spice-ext for more satellites. The list of satellites in each file can be found on the download page.
On Linux you also need to install libcalceph before you can use this function: https://github.com/pchev/libcalceph/releases/tag/v1.0.0

New functions:
- Allow to import a mosaic in the observing list
- In Observer tool, stop the telescope motion when releasing the arrow button
- Use the nebula outlines from OpenNGC, add option to select line or surface
- Allow simulation for a single asteroid and comet
- Add menu "Window/Lock chart position" to not move the chart after a search
- Show hour angle and airmass under mouse cursor
- Add telescope handpad for ASCOM and INDI
- Add option to blure and set transparency of surface catalog
- Add pre-pointing feature for asteroid occultation

Bug fix:
- Update Quicksat to support the new magnitude file
- Fix PHD2 comet tracking interface
- Fix setting telescope time
- Planet in line mode must be really transparent 
- Fix "Show Mark" option for comet and asteroid simulation

Removed:
- Move SAC to obsolete catalog, replaced by OpenNGC
- Remove Iridium flare computation
